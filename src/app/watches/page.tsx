            <p>I love watches and i have g-shock ga-100c-4a red color watch.
                this is such a unique watch made by casio (g-shock) and it cost almost 120 dollars.
                I have also some smart watches like watch 6 w26+ and watch 8 max st.steel body watch.
                I like g-shock the most from the above because of it's toughness,durability,water resistance etc.
                It has many features like stopwatch(stanard,lap),alarms(5),world clock,timer and world wide regions,DST
                stopwatch speed indicator and many more.it is a hybrid watch so it has both analog and digital display.
                it is such a cool looking watch and it's red color is such adding power to the wrist.
                I have this watch since 2022.
